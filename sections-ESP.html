        <h1>How Does ESP Work?</h1>
        <p>
            ESP, or Extra Sensory Perception, is a powerful technique that allows players to see through walls, 
            detect enemies, and gain an upper hand in gameplay. This technique is primarily based on reading 
            game memory to extract information about players, items, and objectives that would normally be 
            hidden from view.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Concepts of ESP</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Memory Reading:</strong> ESP relies on accessing game memory to fetch data about player positions and other in-game elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Manipulation:</strong> By manipulating the data retrieved from memory, players can visualize enemy locations on their screen.</li>
            <li><strong>Rendering Overlays:</strong> ESP typically overlays graphics onto the game screen, highlighting enemies or items without altering the game's code.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to Implement ESP</h2>
        <p>
            To implement ESP, one must understand how to read from the game's memory space. This usually involves:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identifying the memory addresses where player data is stored.</li>
            <li>Using appropriate tools and scripts to read and display this data in real time.</li>
            <li>Creating an overlay that integrates with the game's graphical output to display the relevant information.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            While the full implementation requires technical skills and knowledge of programming, this overview provides a foundational understanding of how ESP works.
